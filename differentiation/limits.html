          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold pt-6">- Limits</h2>
          <p>The limit of a function \(f(x)\) is the value that the function gets closer to as x approaches a stated value.<br/>
          For example, the limit of \(f(x)\) as x approaches a is written: \[\lim_{x \to a}f(x)\]</p>

          <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-gray-600 pl-6 my-6">
            <p>A point where a function is undefined is shown on a graph with an open circle. This occurs when the function either has a zero on the denominator, or both the numerator and denominator, as any number divided by zero is undefined.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
          <p><em>&bullet; Consider the following function: \[f(x) = \frac{(x-3)(x+4)}{(x+4)}\]</em></p>
          <p>This function is undefined at \(x=-4\), as \(\frac{0}{0} = \text{undefined}\). This will be shown as an open circle at the point (-4, -7) on a graph.</p>
          <p>The limit of this function is therefore -7, as \(x\) approaches -4 from both sides:
            \[\lim_{x \to -4} \frac{(x-3)(x+4)}{(x+4)} = -7\]
          </p>

          <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-gray-600 pl-6 my-6">
            <p>For a limit to exist, the variable must approach the stated value from both sides. This means that if we get a sudden jump between values, the limit does not exist, or is undefined.</p>

            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
              <li>A removable (or point) discontinuity is where \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) \ne f(a)\) or \(f(a)\) doesn't exist. There is a hole at \(x=a\).</li>
              <li>Jump (or step) discontinuities happen when \(\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) \ne \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)\). There is a break in the curve at the stated value.</li>
              <li>Infinite discontinuities occur when \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty \text{ or} -\infty\). The limit would be at the asymptote, but it extends to \(\infty\), so it is undefined.</li>
            </ol>
          </blockquote>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold pt-6">- Continuity, Domain and Range</h2>
          <p>A function is continuous if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen off the paper. That means that a function \(f(x)\) is continuous at point \(a\) if \(f(a)\) is defined, \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) is defined, and \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)\). If a function has a hole, a jump, or an asymptote, then it is discontinuous.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-gray-600 pl-6 my-6">
            <p>Linear, quadratic, and cubic functions are all continuous.</p>
            <p>The function:
              \[f(x) = \frac{(x - 3)(x + 4)}{(x + 4)}\]
              is not a linear function as it has a hole at (-4, -7) and is therefore discontinuous.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The domain of a function is the set of x-values that has been used to define the function. Sometimes functions are drawn within the constraint of a specific domain. Doing this can remove a discontinuitiy from a graph.</p>
          <p>For example, if the function:
            \[f(x) = \frac{(x - 3)(x + 4)}{(x + 4)}\]
            was graphed over the domain \(x > -3\), then the hole at \(x = -4\) would be missed out, so the graph is continuous over this domain.
          </p><br/>

          <p>The range of a function are the y-values that the function covers entirely, inside the stated domain.</p>
          <p>For example: if a graph starts at \(x = -7\) and doesn't go higher than \(y = 4\), we would say the domain is \(-7 \leq x\) and the range is \(y \leq 4\).</p>

          <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-gray-600 pl-6 my-6">
            <p>Note: you may be required to identify whether a function is continuous and state the domain and range in your exam, so make sure you understand how to.</p><br/>

            <p>You can also write the domain in set-builder notation.</p>
            <p>For example: \(\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x \geq 4\}\)</p>
            <p>Means: the set of all numbers \(x\), that are a member of Real Numbers, such that \(x\) is greater than or equal to 4.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold pt-6">- Gradient, Concavity and Differentiability</h2>
          <p>The gradient of a curve at a point is a measure of how steep the curve it. It is also known as the tangent of the curve at a certain point. The slope of a straight line is:
            \[\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} \text{ or } \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\]
          </p>
          <p>We can also refer to the gradient of a function at a point as the derivative of the function at that particular point.</p>

          <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-gray-600 pl-6 my-6">
            <p>Note: gradient values of a function will be different at different values of \(x\).</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Sometimes there can be a point on the graph where we cannot find the gradient. This often happens if there is a discontinuity, such as a hole in the curve, or if there is a sudden change in the gradient, such as a sharp corner.</p>
          <p>At points when we are unable to find a gradient (derivative), we say that the graph is not differentiable at those points.</p><br/>

          <p>Some graphs exhibit concavity. A curve can either be concave up, concave down, or a combination of both. A section of the graph is concave up when the gradients of that section increase as \(x\) increases and concave down when the gradients decrease.</p>
          <p>The point at which a graph changes from concave up to concave down (and vice verse) is called a point of inflection.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold pt-6">- Finding Limits</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc px-6 items-left">
            <li class="font-bold py-4">Approach 1</li>
            <p>We can algebraically eliminate common factors and then substitute the value that <em>x</em> tends to. This is the easier of the two methods as we just need to check if there is a common factor on both the numerator and the denominator. If so, we divide by the common factor and substitute to find the limit.</p>
            <p>\[\eqalign{\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2-4}{x-2} &= \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{(x+2)(x-2)}{(x-2)} \\ &= \lim_{x \to 2} (x+2) \\ &= (2+2) \\ &= 4}\]</p>

            <li class="font-bold py-4">Approach 2</li>
            <p>If we can't find a common factor for the numerator and denominator, then we can substitute values that are very close to but not at the value of the limit (2 in this example).</p>
            <p>When \(x = 1.99, \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2-4}{x-2}\)<br/>
            &nbsp;\(= \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{1.99^2-4}{1.99-2}\)<br/>
            &nbsp;\(= 3.99\)</p>

            <p>When \(x = 2.01, \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2-4}{x-2}\)<br/>
            &nbsp;\(= \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{2.01^2-4}{2.01-2}\)<br/>
            &nbsp;\(= 4.01\)</p>

            <p>Because the values from both sides when approaching 2 are close to 4, the limit when \(x=2\) is 4.</p>
